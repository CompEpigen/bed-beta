   # Inputs:
   #    Y:       N by 2*D character matrix where each row is a barcode pair and 
   #             each element must equal T,C,G,A. D=7 is the barcode length.
   #    counts:  numeric vector of length N containing the read count for each barcode pair
   #    
   #
   # Outputs:
   #    model:  list where element q is the output from the LL function
   #    rho:    no of latent components
